part1 - Program Fuzzing:
We used strings target command to inspect the strings. Since the
strings were "meaningful", we chose: password, fuzzing, security, crash_input,
ECE568, and shellcode.

part2 - Library Fuzzing:
For task1, we opened the input file and obtained the file size using fstat. Then,
we allocated memory to buffer and copied file contents to there. Lastly, we called
ip_parse using the file size and created buffer.
For task2, we first cast new_buf to a pointer of struct iphdr (from header file netinet/ip.h) to 
access IP fields easier. We set the checksum field to 0, and then computed the valid checksum. Lastly,
we put the computed checksum to new_buf.

part3 - Web Server Fuzzing:
