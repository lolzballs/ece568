Part 1 Explanation:
To find the IPv4 address I ran the following and looked at the A record in the
ANSWER section:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca

To find the name servers I ran the following and looked at the NS records in
the ANSWER section and connected them with the glue A records in the ADDITIONAL
section:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca NS

Mail servers were found using:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca MX
The MX record returned in the ANSWER section does not contain an IP, so I
took the data and resolved it with dig again.

The BIND server returned the same results, and queries were performed by:
	dig @127.0.0.1 -p <port> <args...>
