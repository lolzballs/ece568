Part 1 Explanation:
To find the IPv4 address I ran the following and looked at the A record in the
ANSWER section:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca

To find the name servers I ran the following and looked at the NS records in
the ANSWER section and connected them with the glue A records in the ADDITIONAL
section:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca NS

Mail servers were found using:
	dig ecf.utoronto.ca MX
The MX record returned in the ANSWER section does not contain an IP, so I
took the data and resolved it with dig again.

The BIND server returned the same results, and queries were performed by:
	dig @127.0.0.1 -p <port> <args...>

Part 2 Explanation:
This is some simple socket programming. In order to multiplex multiple requests,
a tuple of (request domain, query id) is used to identify a request/response.
When a query comes from a client, the client's address is saved in a dictionary
using this identifier as the key, before forwarding the request to the server.
When the server replies, the queried domain and id are extracted to lookup the
client address from when the query originated, and the response is forwarded to
that client.

Part 3 Explanation:
When a query comes in with qname = "example.com.", we immediately send back a
response with the required A answer, NS authority, and glue records.
