target1:
The strcpy in foo() will buffer overflow `buf` if given argv[1] with >272 chars.
To exploit this, the location of the return address of lab_main() relative to the
beginning of `buf` was found to be 0x158. A shellcode is placed at the start of
`buf`, which is then followed with arbitrary padding bytes until the 0x158-th
element, where the address of `buf` is placed. This address was found to be
0x40A4FD70 on ECF lab computers, but on other systems a lower address was found.
Thus NOP bytes were added to the beginning of `buf` to make the exploit more
portable.
