target1:
The strcpy in foo() will buffer overflow `buf` if given argv[1] with >272 chars.
To exploit this, the location of the return address of lab_main() relative to the
beginning of `buf` was found to be 0x158. A shellcode is placed at the start of
`buf`, which is then followed with arbitrary padding bytes until the 0x158-th
element, where the address of `buf` is placed. This address was found to be
0x40A4FD70 on ECF lab computers, but on other systems a lower address was found.
Thus NOP bytes were added to the beginning of `buf` to make the exploit more
portable.

target2:
foo() copies the input string to buf, but can overflow by 20 bytes. We cannot
directly modify the return address since it is located at 36 bytes past the end
of buf. len resides at 16 to 20 bytes past the end of buf. Thus we can
arbitarily set len using our attack buffer to increase the iterations of the
loop. j is also located on the stack, so we set j to 0x127 to reach the return
address. This attack buffer contains NULL bytes, which are dealt with by passing
input following the NULLs in new strings in envp.

target3:
bar() copies a maximum of 103 bytes from user-supplied input to &targ[12].
Since buf/targ only has 67 bytes, there is an overflow of 48 bytes. buf is in
the stack frame of foo(), so we target the return address in that function
instead, which is at &buf[88]. This is within our overflow-able range so it is
straight forward to override the return address with &buf, where the shellcode
is located.

target4:
foo() copies the input string to buf up to 231 characters, which is specified 
by the variable len. Since the return address is located after the 231th byte
of buf, we need to modify the parameters of for-loop in order to write to the 
return address. Specifically, we modified the variables i and len to write 
past 231th byte of buf. Modifying variables i and len was possible because 
the length of buf was 203 and foo() copied 231 characters. Also, it was possible
because i and len were located at &buf[216] and &buf[220] respectively. 

target5:
foo() uses snprintf() to copy 512 bytes of &formatString[58] to buf. 
We put the address of the return address at the front of formatString and put 
shellcode at the end. We put the actual "format string" at &formatString[58] 
since snprintf() starts copying from there. In the "format string," we first 
put three %llx to make current argument pointer point to the address 
of return address stored in formatString. By controlling the number of 
printed characters and using %hhn, we wrote the address of our shellcode to 
the address of return address.
